        <p> The golem is widely regarded as a card that doesn't take skill. 
           The Golem’s origins are unknown. It was once said that he was forged from the mountains of the Himalayas. People believe that he feeds off the fear of children and adults alike. However, Golem was never like this.

He began his journey by swimming across the Indian Ocean to South Africa. There, Golem wandered through different places and settled near villages and cities. However, he was often ridiculed and blamed for the evil in the world. Even though Golem never appeared to be the most friendly being, he was kind at heart.

Afterward, he traveled to Renaissance England, where he was declared a witch. As a result, he had to face the horrors of flogging and burning at the stake. Through all the pain, Golem survived thanks to his rock-hard body. After attempting to end his own life, he was suddenly teleported to the Clash Royale world.

Although this new world was cheerful and full of diverse people, Golem was never the same. He became quiet. But through his silence, he was always smiling at us, through the screen, waiting until he could finally let it all out.
